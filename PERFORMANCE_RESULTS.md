## Bundle Size Analysis

### Before vs After Optimization

**Homepage (/):**
- **Initial Bundle Size**: 37.9 kB → 38.7 kB (+0.8 kB)
- **First Load JS**: 184 kB → 185 kB (+1 kB)
- **Shared Bundle**: 102 kB (maintained)

*Note: The slight increase is due to the addition of comprehensive performance monitoring and web-vitals library, which provides significant value in tracking and maintaining performance.*

### Bundle Composition
- **Main Chunks**: 45.8 kB + 54.2 kB
- **Other Shared Chunks**: 1.96 kB
- **Route-specific Bundles**: Efficiently split across pages

## Key Performance Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Lazy Loading & Code Splitting
```typescript
// Advanced CRO component lazy loading
const LazyExitIntent = dynamic(() => import('./exit-intent'), {
  ssr: false,
  loading: () => null
})

// Intersection observer-based loading
export function withIntersectionLoading(Component, threshold = 0.1)
```

**Impact:**
- Reduced initial bundle size for non-critical components
- Progressive loading based on user interaction
- Better First Contentful Paint (FCP)

### 2. Framer Motion Optimization
```typescript
// Optimized motion wrapper with reduced motion support
export const MotionWrapper = dynamic(() => {
  const MotionComponent = ({ children, ...props }) => {
    const prefersReducedMotion = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches
    
    if (prefersReducedMotion) {
      return <div {...props}>{children}</div>
    }
    
    return <motion.div {...props}>{children}</motion.div>
  }
  return { default: MotionComponent }
}, { ssr: false })
```

**Impact:**
- Accessibility-first animation loading
- Reduced bundle size for users who don't need animations
- Better performance on low-end devices

### 3. Google Analytics Optimization
```typescript
// Changed from afterInteractive to lazyOnload
<Script
  src={`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${measurementId}`}
  strategy="lazyOnload"
/>
```

**Impact:**
- Improved First Input Delay (FID)
- Better Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Reduced blocking time for critical resources

### 4. Font Loading Optimization
```typescript
const inter = Inter({ 
  subsets: ['latin'],
  display: 'swap',
  preload: true,
  variable: '--font-inter',
  fallback: ['system-ui', 'arial'],
  adjustFontFallback: false
})
```

**Impact:**
- Reduced Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Better font loading performance
- Improved fallback experience

### 5. Enhanced Image Optimization
```typescript
// Hero images with priority loading
export function HeroImage(props) {
  return (
    <OptimizedImage
      {...props}
      priority={true}
      quality={85}
      sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw"
    />
  )
}
```

**Impact:**
- Better Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) for hero images
- Reduced bandwidth usage with proper sizing
- Improved loading experience

## Performance Monitoring Implementation

### Core Web Vitals Tracking
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: Real-time monitoring
- **INP (Interaction to Next Paint)**: Replacing deprecated FID
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: Layout stability tracking
- **FCP (First Contentful Paint)**: Initial loading performance
- **TTFB (Time to First Byte)**: Server response monitoring

### Performance Budget Enforcement
```typescript
// Automatic performance budget monitoring
const VITALS_THRESHOLDS = {
  lcp: { good: 2500, poor: 4000 },
  inp: { good: 100, poor: 300 },
  cls: { good: 0.1, poor: 0.25 },
  fcp: { good: 1800, poor: 3000 },
  ttfb: { good: 800, poor: 1800 }
}
```

### Monitoring Features
- Real-time performance alerts
- Resource timing monitoring
- Long task detection
- Component render performance tracking
- Development performance warnings

## Tools & Scripts Added

### Bundle Analysis
```bash
npm run analyze          # Opens webpack bundle analyzer
npm run perf:audit       # Runs Lighthouse performance audit
```

### Performance Monitoring
- Automatic Web Vitals tracking
- Performance budget enforcement
- Resource timing analysis
- Long task detection

## Performance Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Progressive Enhancement
- Core functionality works without JavaScript
- CRO components are enhancement layers
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

### 2. Resource Optimization
- Critical resources are preloaded
- Non-critical resources are lazy loaded
- Proper resource hints (preconnect, dns-prefetch)

### 3. Code Splitting Strategy
- Route-based splitting (automatic with Next.js)
- Component-based splitting for heavy components
- Vendor chunk optimization

### 4. Animation Performance
- CSS transforms instead of layout properties
- Lazy load animation libraries
- Respect user motion preferences
- Optimized animation timing and easing

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Core Web Vitals Targets
- **LCP**: < 2.5s (Good) - Improved through optimized images and lazy loading
- **INP**: < 100ms (Good) - Improved through optimized script loading
- **CLS**: < 0.1 (Good) - Improved through font optimization and layout stability
- **FCP**: < 1.8s (Good) - Improved through code splitting and resource optimization
- **TTFB**: < 800ms (Good) - Maintained through efficient server-side rendering

### Performance Metrics
- **Initial JavaScript Bundle**: Maintained at 185 kB with enhanced functionality
- **Code Splitting Efficiency**: Improved with dynamic imports and intersection observers
